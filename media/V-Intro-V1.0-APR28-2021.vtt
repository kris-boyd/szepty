00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.320
Mental health awareness campaigns often ask us to break the silence.

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.100
But the decision to speak, or not to speak, is a complicated one.

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.160
And the question of how we describe our experiences is just as complicated.

4
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.190
The language of mental health is shaped by particular histories, which

5
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.580
reverberate in the present.

6
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.640
As the descendent of people who didn’t talk about mental health for generations,

7
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.010
I’m curious about speech and silence.

8
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.650
My context, as a settler Canadian who benefits from a colonial occupation, is

9
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.200
very different from the context of my ancestors, Poles who lived under Soviet,

10
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.950
Nazi, and Austro-Hungarian regimes.

11
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.930
I can’t solve their silence because I don’t know what speaking meant to them.

12
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.520
I don’t know how they understood their minds and bodies, or how they gave voice

13
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.030
to that understanding. I don’t know how they communicated what they didn’t have

14
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.320
words for. I wonder: what words do you use?

15
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.280
Whose words do you use?

16
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.310
How did they reach you? Through stories?

17
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.150
Omissions? Songs?

18
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.080
Contradictions? Rituals?

19
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.240
Inferences? Sensations?

20
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.910
Whispers? When do your words run out?

21
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.870
What does your silence hold space for?

22
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.020
I brought these questions to seven other artists.

23
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.850
Click begin to explore their responses.

24
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.630
Each page will ask you to choose between two fragments.

25
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.110
Different choices will lead to different outcomes.
