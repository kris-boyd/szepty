00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.240
VERONIQUE: There was always a “before” and “after.”

2
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.600
Not before and after migration – at least, not exactly.

3
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.350
Something else shaped these two worlds that my mother moved between.

4
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.730
I couldn’t follow her – but sometimes, when the door was ajar, I could peer

5
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.830
through. From a young age, I was pulled towards the places

6
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.370
where reality shows its cracks, its seams.

7
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.410
At every opening, I strained my ears, listening for snatches of the other side.

8
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.360
Sometimes, this sense of not fully being “here” was an electric charge,

9
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.690
an incantation, a miraculous melting away of selfhood.

10
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.410
Sometimes, it was a riptide, which hooked my limbs and sent me spinning into the

11
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.870
dark. I couldn’t follow her, so I went somewhere else.

12
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.580
Still, when I lifted the escape hatch, or slipped between the trees,

13
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.730
part of me searched for the sweep of her shadow,

14
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.510
the flicker of her footfalls, the whisper of her breath.
